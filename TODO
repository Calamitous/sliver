Make the actual, you know, templating part.
On first pass, should templates be rendered down to interpolated strings?
  eval? or fast sub-template? or arrayification + join?
jam all tags together?  yeah, forget whitespace
Safety all evaled strings
escape all html'ed text?
de-monkeypatch Array and Hash, subclass and add a to_ method to A/H?

Rendering assumes a single pass... should be idempotent?
should affect all nodes found by selector
rails pluginate

Allow blocks in tag arrays
convert templates to tag arrays & update/render from there?
check perf of hashtable lookup vs to_s conversion
